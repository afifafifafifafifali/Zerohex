# The official github repository for the Zerohex programming language.

## Introduction

This project is an open-source project. The mission of this project to help developers develop blazing fast softwares. The project also has an aim to make the code user-readable and understandable like Python. I hope that we will make a combination and alternative of C++ and Python. This project was originally developed by Afif Ali Saadman. The backbone of this project is designed in C.
