# The official github repository for the Zerohex programming language.

## Introduction

This project is an open-source project. The mission of this project to help developers develop blazing fast softwares. The project also has an aim to make the code user-readable and understandable like Python. I hope that we will make a combination and alternative of C++ and Python. This project was originally developed by Afif Ali Saadman. The backbone of this project is designed in C.

## Compilation Of the Interpreter

Execute in your terminal(You need to have gcc, g++,make,ld)

```
make clean && make
```
## Coding using Zerohex
The file format for Zerohex has been chosen as ```.zhs``` for the source file(The full form: ZeroHex Source file) , and for the headers, they will get ```.zhh``` (Full form: Zero Hex Header File.)

**Printing**:
If you want to print or display something to the console, use print() function. This is a builtin-function.
E.G. ```print("Hi zerohex");``` Note that , when ending a code, end with semicolon.
Variable:
``` print(someVariable); ```
``` print(someVariable, someVariable2); ```
**Data Types**:
Currently, there are 4 data types: float, int, str, char.
Declaration : ``` var myInt = 123; var myFloat = 1.23 ; var myStr = "Love"; var myChar = 'l';```
